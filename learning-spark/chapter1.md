#### chapter 1: Introduction to Apache Spark: A Unified Analytics Engine

- While *GFS* provided a fault-tolerant and *distributed filesystem* across many com
modity hardware servers in a cluster farm, *Bigtable* offered scalable storage of
structured data across GFS. *MR* introduced a new parallel programming paradigm, based on functional programming, for large-scale processing of data distributed over GFS and Bigtable.
-  The central thrust of the Spark project was to bring in ideas borrowed from Hadoop Map‐
Reduce, but to enhance the system: make it highly fault tolerant and embarrassingly
parallel, support in-memory storage for intermediate results between iterative and
interactive map and reduce computations, offer easy and composable APIs in multi‐
ple languages as a programming model, and support other workloads in a unified
manner. 
- **Apache Spark** is a *unified* engine designed for large-scale *distributed data processing*,
on premises in data centers or in the cloud
