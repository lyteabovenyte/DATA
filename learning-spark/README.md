learning **spark** book:  
spark: the facto big data unified processing engine.

- as the author said: While there are many topics we have chosen to cover, there are a few that we have
opted to not focus on. These include the older low-level Resilient Distributed Dataset
(RDD) APIs and GraphX, Spark’s API for graphs and graph-parallel computation.
Nor have we covered advanced topics such as how to extend Spark’s Catalyst opti‐
mizer to implement your own operations, how to implement your own catalog, or
how to write your own DataSource V2 data sinks and sources.
so it's a good idea to have a look at these interesting topics.
